# eft_analyzer
Module 7 Challenge


The project is analyzing a fintech ETF that consists of four stocks" GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. The data of each stock is saved in the `etf.db` database. The project analyzes the daily returns of the ETF stocks both individually and as a whole. Then deploy the visualizations to a web application by using the `Voila` library.
